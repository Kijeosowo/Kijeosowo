            <h1>Discover The Secret Method For Avoiding Breakfast That EVEN Burna Boy Wish He Knew, And Women Would Kill To Delete From The Internet !!!</h1>
            <p>My fellow Comrade
              Have you ever seen a man cry? I mean, hot premium tears with cattarh running down his nostrils… 
              If you haven’t then permit me to tell you the story of my friend Emeka who just got stabbed by this heartless daughter of Jezebel. And as you carefully read every word,              
              You will see how Emeka ignored all the deadly signs I am about to reveal to you. . .
              Got himself in an ugly situation with a woman who he loved (and thought also loved him too)
              Ended up in one emotional damaging moment of his life that cost him his self confidence, money and time..
              And you will begin to realize what you need to do to never fall into such wicked trap
              And save yourself from unnecessary heartbreak.. But first, I want you to hear from Emeka himself as he narrates his story… 
              It was a rainy Saturday afternoon… Hunger dey catch me but as rain dey fall, I nor gre go outside... As you can guess, it was f**king cold.
              Finally, I summoned the courage to go downstairs from my one-bedroom apartment… And entered my “sleek-looking” 2012 Black Honda Accord and drove out… 
              Buga restaurant was just 5 minutes drive from my house…  
              And in no time,  I had grabbed my favorite (chicken and chips) in a takeaway pack waiting to get home and devour it…. 
              While on my way back home, I got stuck in a little traffic… So I had to hold for a moment…  
              My head was buried down as… I looked through my iPhone 12ProMax to check ifJide (my G) had replied to the message I sent him earlier…
              While responding to his message... I realized that the traffic had eased and…  As I raised my head 
              I noticed this gorgeous 5ft2 goddess standing under the rain In awe, I wondered What Could a “Goddess” Be Doing Under The Rain?
              As you could imagine, I quickly looked for the closest spot to park my car…

              I reached out to my back seat to pick up my umbrella… 

              And went straight to where this “goddess in human flesh” was standing… 

              As I drew closer, my hands were trembling… 

              Not because of the cold this time, BUT because of the beauty I saw… 

              Amaka was indeed a goddess… 

              The type you see ONLY in Nollywood movies… 

              Her brown eyes were like flames of fire 

              Her body was everything I ever wanted in a woman

              Her skin was like glass, I could literally see my reflection… 

              Not to talk about her shape, 

              </p>

          <div class="pages2">
            <p>Damnnnn 

              She had a complete coca-cola bottle shaped body with… 
              
              Two well fitted boobs (Standing firm like the statue of liberty) 
              
              And a beautiful backside to complement her angelic face 
              
              As I moved closer, I saw her smiling as I approached her.
              
              Long story short 
              
              I asked to drop her off at her place (about 20 minutes drive from there) after which we exchanged contact and… 
              
              That Was How It All STARTED…  
              
              From WhatsApp Chats to Phone calls 
              
              We got talking…
              
              From casual talks… 
              
              It started getting serious…  
              
              We started talking every now and then…
              
              All I wanted was just for us to be together… 
              
              And spend some time getting to know each other better… 
              
              But before you knew it, love don cover my eyes. 
              
              That was how we started dating exactly 27 days after we first met
              
              I started keeping late nights just to set eyes on this damsel…  
              
              Even though we were both busy with work, we NEVER failed to make out time for each other… 
              
              We hanged out often and spent quality time together… 
              
              We spent extended hours on phone calls and I’m sure even the network provider knew we were two crazy love birds because… 
              
              We were always spending extended hours on calls…. 
              
              At night, I gaze at the ceiling endlessly…
              
              Wishing my baby was right in my arms
              
              And in the morning, the first voice I craved to hear was hers.
              
              We could not go a day without hearing each other's voice
              
              Whenever I was with my homies…
              <span>Na Amaka matter I dey always talk</span> 

              The whole estate knew us both…  

              I had changed her name from Amaka to “Love Of My Life”

              And Yes, she really was the love of my life

              We were both crazily in love (At least, as far as I knew)… 

              Amaka dey burst my head on a steady… 

              Seconds turn into minutes… 

              Minutes turn into hours… 

              Hours turn into days… 

              Days turn into weeks… 

              And still, it looks like it is only getting better… 

              Weeks into months…

              Then all of a sudden…
              I Began To NOTICE Some “Kurukere Waka”

              Babe started giving me space 

              When I call her she will either ignore my call or.. 

              She will pick up and tell me she’s busy and can’t talk now… 

              And even after she was done, she still won’t return my call… 

              She kept giving me stupid excuses here and there… 

              But as a patient guy, I gave her the benefit of doubt…  

              On the 24th Of March, 2020. 

              She finally came to visit after 4weeks of flimsy excuses…

            <p>We spent some good time together after which she dozed off but… 

              I was still awake 
              
              Next thing, I saw a message come in her WhatsApp repeatedly
              
              I picked it up  
              
              Pointed it to her face, and the faceID unlocked… 
              
              Sharp, I went straight to her WhatsApp… 
              
              And the next thing I saw almost… 
              
              <span>Made My Heart STOP Beating !!!</span>
              
              I saw her full chat with Mr James, (the man she told me was her boss)... 
              
              I found out that all these while that babe was forming busy… 
              
              <span>She was busy knacking her boss</span>
              
              Even better than she used to give it to me… 
              
              With all the craziest styles and p*rn standard positions… 
              
              Chai 
              
              My hands went cold as I scrolled through their conversation… 
              
              For a second it felt like I was dreaming…  
              
              This is the babe that I loved with all of my heart…  
              
              I had invested so much in the relationship…  
              
              E no get time wey I no dey turn up for Amaka
              
              Two weeks before then, I just replaced her cracked phone with a Brand New iPhone12 ProMax like mine…

              Little did I know that her “Goddamn motherf**king Boss” was also bankrolling this bi*ch…  

He was the one sponsoring her doings in exchange for what? 

…premium knacking.. 

I thought she was responsible….

Not knowing that I was wasting my precious time with a bi*ch… 

And as 2face said… 

<span> Amaka Disappoint Me !!! </span>

This is the story of my friend Emeka…

And like Emeka, you might have experienced this before 

<span> A Terrible Heartbreak !!! </span>

Maybe you had a little issue with your babe… 

And the next thing…

She decided to quit the relationship…  

Maybe you caught her  cheating on you…  

All of a sudden, the “love of your life” has become “The dog of the town”...

Distributing her cupcake everywhere like a whore… 

And you think to yourself… “All women are sluts”

Maybe she dumped you because she met Odogwu

Who was spoiling her with massive doings…

And then you begin to think…  

Maybe all women care about is money 

You say to yourself 

<span>Omo, make I go hustle ooo, na who get money dey see beta woman </span>

Or maybe you are currently in a relationship and

              Now listen, let me make this clearer to you… 
              
              I’m sure you know that there was a time when Malaria was a killer disease in  Africa right?
              
              People died of malaria in their millions… 
              
              Apart from the fact that there was no cure at the time, one of the major reasons why people died of malaria was because…
              
              They could not detect the signs So, for instance.. 

              Someone could be feeling feverish… 
              
              And they will say it’s ordinary fever..  
              
              Not knowing that fever was just one of the signs of malaria and …
              
              And as a result… 
              
              Millions of people died.. 
              
              It's the same thing with breakfast…
              
              One of the major reasons why you may have been chopping breakfast is not because relationships is hard… 
              
              Or because relationship is not for you…  
              
              Neither is it because women are wicked…  
              
              Of course I know there are some “daughters of jezebel” out there in the name of ladies with fine faces and devilish characters.
              
              But I need you to understand they are not the cause of your breakfast… 
              
              As a matter of fact, <span>The Reason Why You Collect Breakfast Is Simply Because..</span>

                I want you to think about this… 
                
                When it comes to relationships and dating…
                
                I have played this game… 
                
                As at my last count, I have dated at least 24 ladies…  
                
                Some super wise and some extremely foolish… 
                
                I served over 90% of them breakfast… 
                
                And I was also served so badly (by the one I finally truly fell in love with)….  
                
                So, I am not some mummy’s boy in this game… 
                
                This is what I have lived and breathe for many years

                Even get much more deeply in love…

               <P>Phew…. That’s a lot right?</P>
              <h1>Now I Want You To THINK About This For a Moment….</h1>
              <p>Think about it very deeply… 

                Imagine you had this kind of information right at your fingertips 
                
                Do you think you would have spent all that money you spent on that crazy ass bitch who <span>ended up turning you to office?</span> 
                
                Do you think that “Gold Digger of a girl” you called your ex girl who wrecked your heart would have messed up with you? 
                
                Do you think that “cheerful giver” of a girlfriend that was distributing her market all over the neighborhood would have been able to still serve you breakfast?
                
                Or 
                
                Do you think you’ll be afraid of losing your current babe who doesn’t even give a f**k about you? 
                
                Well I guess you know the answer to that… 
                
                Now, let me ask you… 
                
                How much do you think that kind of book is worth? 
                
                Definitely around 15-20K right? 
                
                And even at that it is nothing compared to all the monies you have spent on her right?
                
                Good 
                
                Now, I know you might probably be thinking in your mind.. 
                
                “Wetin them one talk wey I never hear before”
                
                And that’s because you have read several other books about relationships and  it didn't change anything… 
                
                Them still serve you…  
                
                Or perhaps, you are thinking… 
                
                Nobody can AVOID breakfast, na normal thing na..

                What is the guarantee that this book will help me find the right babe? 
                
                If any of these is your concern, then my friend you have no problem at all..
                
                Because I am going to give you four answers to that question…

                  And as you can see from the testimonials you read…  
                  
                  It is not the kind of thing your relationship coach will come on Instagram Live or Twitter Space to share…
                  
                  Because most of them don't even know what it is… 
                  
                  And the few who know will almost never share it for free… 
                  
                  And it is intentional… 
                  
                  They know what it cost them to learn it..  
                  
                  The painful experience and heartbreaking frustrations… 
                  
                  And so they will almost never share it for FREE 
                  
                  But here I am

                    <p>Now, I know you're probably thinking why I priced such sacred information so low… 

                      I will tell you 
                      
                      You know, when my ex served me breakfast… 
                      
                      It was so devastating for me…  
                      
                      Very devastating… 
                      
                      At some point, I almost lost my mind… 
                      
                      No jokes… 
                      
                      I remember those days back in May 2019 when it all started…  
                      
                      I was unable to concentrate at work…  
                      
                      During the day, it was a rollercoaster of moodiness… 
                      
                      And at night, I would sob like a baby and  cry my eyes out…
                      
                      It was not funny
                      </p>

                      <h1>I Used To Think It Was Only Women That Were Used And Dumped BUT</h1>
                      <p>At that point, I felt so USED AND DUMPED like a N50 toilet paper in a short-time lodge.  

                        A relationship of 2years and 6months… 
                        
                        Flushed down the drain just like that…  
                        
                        When I think about it… 
                        
                        I wished I had someone who could have handed me such a book…  
                        
                        Maybe a year before she serve me breakfast 
                        
                        Or 6 months before then… 
                        
                        Or maybe even 3months before then… 
                        
                        I definately would not have gone through the kind of Hell and Emotional Torture I went through all in the name of love 
                        
                        But I did, <span>I suffered like a madman and I came out of it …</span>
                        
                        And now, I am handing you the same material I wish I had 5 years ago…  
                        
                        So, you don’t have to go through the pain and disappointment I went through when the “Love Of My Life” decided to serve me… 
                        
                        With that said… 
                        
                        I want you to know that I will never try to convince you to get this book…  
                        
                        I’ll never do that…

                        I believe you are an adult and you are intelligent enough to know what is best for you….
                        
                        I cannot come and be telling you what to do with your heart and your money…

                          <p>I know this has been a very long letter but I have two last things to say to tell you in just two minutes…  

                            First
                            
                            I know that there might be someone reading this who is saying…  
                            
                            “But I am not in any relationship right now so I don’t need this book..
                            
                            And that might be you… 
                            
                            It’s fine… After all, relationship is not for everybody..
                            
                            Maybe you are a Monk, which is absolutely fine… 
                            
                            Or
                            
                            You are saying “my babe loves me so much and she will never serve me breakfast”
                            
                            I laugh you in spanish
                            </p>
                            <img src="Image/laughing.jpg" alt="No Image">
                            <p>Now, let me ask you a question…</p>
                            <h1>Imagine You Were Challenged To a Fight…</h1>
                            <p>With an enemy who has sworn with his life to beat the living daylight out of you.. 

                              And the fight is going to happen In exactly 3 days from today.. 
                              
                              When do you think will be the best time to enroll for a boxing class?
                              
                              Right this very moment when you still have some time to learn some deadly skill 
                              
                              Or 
                              
                              You will wait till the third day when you are standing right in front of him?
                              
                              I guess you know the answer to that already..
                              
                              Now, the best time to learn how to fight is not when you are standing before this nigga who has sworn to beat the shit out of you.
                              
                              No, if you try am.. You go collect.
                              
                              Rather, the best time to learn how to fight is way before the fight ever happens… 
                              
                              When you do this, you will become like a walking weapon..
                              
                              And when he approaches you, then you can be rest assured that you’ll beat him mercilessly and choke the f**k out of him.
                              </p>
                            <img src="Image/fight.jpg" alt="No Image">
                            <p>It is the same… 

                              You don't wait until you are in a relationship or them serve you breakfast before you learn how to avoid breakfast…
                              
                              No 
                              
                              You learn ahead of time so that even when your babe decides to display oloriburuku (unfortunate) tendencies she go collect.</p>
                              <a href="#">I WANT THIS BOOK ASAP</a>
                              <P>Second and lastly.. 

                                Even though I decided to price this book so low
                                
                                It doesn’t mean it will remain that way for long… 
                                
                                The reason is because 
                                
                                Like I said earlier, this book contains information that women will literally kill to delete from the internet.. 
                                
                                And as I speak to you, my former ads account was reported severally and was banned by facebook because of this eBook…
                                </P>
                                <img src="Image/payment.jpg" alt="No Image">
                                <p>And when I did my findings, I discovered that it was women who were reporting the account.. 

                                  They know the truth, and so they are doing everything within their power to make sure that you don’t get to lay your hands on the secrets that I shared in this book. 
                                  
                                  Because once you do, then they will never be able to play game or any dirty tricks with you. 
                                  
                                  And they don’t want that.. 
                                  
                                  So, if you leave this page now and decide to order tomorrow
                                  
                                  There is nothing wrong with that… 
                                  
                                  It’s just that you might never find this page again... 
                                  
                                  And even if you find me…
                                  </p>
                                  <h1>You Will Never Find It At This Price…</h1>

                                      The other day when she said she wanted to buy brazilian hair, how much did you send her? 
                                      
                                      The last time she told you she liked that gown she saw at that boutique, how much did you send her?

It doesn’t <br>mean we are bad, or stupid, or anything like  that, it just means that most things of <br>any complexity take awhile to learn.
